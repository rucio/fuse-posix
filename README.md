# Rucio `FUSE-posix` interface

This repository carries the best attempt at making the Rucio namespace `posix`-mountable.

It is based on `C` code (for the custom `FUSE` specialization) and on `C++11` for utilities and wrappers.

This tool is intended as an **alpha** version unless explicitly said and has to be considered WIP.

Please note that the first target is to get a **read-only file system**.

## Access pattern
The Rucio file catalog is much flatter than that of a usual `POSIX` filesystems and as such its representation has to be structured according to that:

- the root of the mount is intended to be a `cvmfs`-like "`/rucio`";
- the first level of the tree (namely `/rucio/*`) should be filled with all the available scopes;
- each scope should appear as a directory filled with its DiDs;
- file DiDs will appear as files;
- container and dataset DiDs will appear as directories;
- datasets and containers might include already represented DiDs: a routine to handle such loops should be present.

## DONEs
- Curl-REST wrapper based on `libcurl` has been implemented in the form of `GET` and `POST` methods, for the moment. The `GET` method has been tested widely and appears to be consistent with the output of the `curl` CLI.
- The curl-REST wrapper uses a singleton-equipped `curl` instance to limit memory fingerprint.
- Rucio-API wrappers, based on Rucio's RESTFul interface, are being developed. At the moment access token retrieval through userpass authentication and scopes listing are implemented and tested.
- Fuse mounting works!
- Rucio-API is now backed with cache, to reduce proactively the number of cURL operations.
- Introduced runtime parsing of configuration file (`settings.json`?) to replace `globals.cpp`. The syntax is clear from the included example file.
- Introduced log-level based logging using submodule `fastlog`[link](https://github.com/gabrielefronze/fastlog).
  As a side note three log levels (ERROR > INFO > DEBUG, in order of reversed gravity and direct verbosity) have been introduced and are usable at runtime:
  
  - `-v` = INFO
  - `-vv` = DEBUG
  - `<no opt>` = ERROR (default)
  
  For example `rucio-fuse-main -v` invokes the software with INFO log level, `rucio-fuse-main -vv` with DEBUG level and so on.

## TODOs
- Implement the read Fuse operation: ***at the moment the file contents are dummy***!
- Introduce certificate-base authentication mechanism.
- Fix Mac OS X mouting issues
- Surely a lot more...

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repository
Fork the repository and clone it on your local machine for development
```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fuse-posix.git
$ cd fuse-posix/
```
### Install the dependencies
Next step is to install the dependencies which shall be required to build the software

**Ubuntu/Debian (apt)**
```BASH
$ sudo apt-get install cmake git g++ libfuse-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
```
**CentOS (yum)**
```BASH
$ yum install -y cmake3 libcurl-devel libfuse-devel
```

### Build the software
To build the software please run:

```[shell]
$ cd fuse-posix/
$ ./build.sh
```
**NOTE:** To complete the build `libcurl-devel`, `fuse-libs` and `fuse-devel` packages (or equivalent) must be present:
`cmake` will try to locate them for you and trigger some build messages if unable to do so.
Please note that `cmake` version 3 or greater is needed.

### Setting up the FUSE mount
If you're Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or above, you should particularly follow this step to ensure the right working of the Rucio-FUSE mount.
* **STEP 1** - Check FUSE version
```BASH
$ fusermount -V
fusermount version: 2.9.7
```
Also check if the `fuse` group is available on the system and your current user is a part of it or not
```BASH
$ groups $USER | grep fuse
```
If this highlights `fuse` then your current USER is a part of the `fuse` group and you may skip STEP 2. If not, then add the `fuse` group as explained in STEP 2.

* **STEP 2** - Add `fuse` group for current USER
```BASH
$ sudo groupadd fuse
$ sudo usermod -aG fuse $USER
```
The above step adds a new group named `fuse` and makes the current user a part of it. If you wish to access the FUSE mount as `root`, then you must also uncomment the line `user_allow_other` in `/etc/fuse.conf` to enable root access for FUSE filesystem. Once this is done successfully, reload the fuse module with `modprobe` or restart the machine.
```
$ modprobe fuse
```

### Mounting with Rucio-FUSE mount
Now that `fusermount` is set up on the machine, we can proceed with the mounting process.
* **OPTION A** - Mounting as `root`

To use FUSE as root, you need to set up fuse module as given in STEP 2, then follow the steps below.
```BASH
$ sudo mkdir /ruciofs
$ cd fuse-posix/
```


## Extra Notes
This has been tested on CentOS7 ~~and Mac OS X Mojave 10.14.6~~.
Mac OS X special files created by the OS FS service generate a lot of issues which should be dealt with and prevent the Fuse module from correct mounting under Mac.
